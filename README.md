I've been using this prompting guide and wanted to try to extend it so that it can get codex to run for even longer. 

https://cookbook.openai.com/articles/codex_exec_plans

My flow is usually
- type a bunch or dictat
- codex creates a PRD from that
- codex creates execplans from that
- codex implements the execplans

My goal here is to update this flow to use 'skills' and use a basic memory system to keep track of the state of the project.
