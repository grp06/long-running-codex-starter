# GETTING STARTED

clone this and go to .agent/scribbles/scrib1.md and just type out what you want. Then tell codex to start the task. It should go for a while.

I've been using this prompting guide and wanted to try to extend it so that it can get codex to run for even longer.

My flow is usually
- type a bunch or dictat
- codex creates a PRD from that
- codex creates execplans from that
- codex implements the execplans

My goal here is to update this flow to use 'skills' and use a basic memory system to keep track of the state of the project.
