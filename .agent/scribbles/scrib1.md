I want to create a simple langgraph application. I want to eventually build a long-running AI agent that can run for a week without interruption. Idk what its gonna do yet, maybe something with lead generation or market research. But before doing that, I wanna build something basic with langgraph to understand the architecture. It's up to you what we build. Just write clean code, look up the lang graph docs, and get this working end to end. I added my OPENAI_API_KEY to the .env file but havent done anything else.
